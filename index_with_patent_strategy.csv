Abbrev,Full Title,Abstract,Zenodo DOI,GitHub_Public,Worth_Patent,Patent_Strategy_Role
BA-FRC,Bad Apples — First-Rate Chaps,"We formalize the public-state dynamics of groups under spectacle-mediated influence. Agents accrue visibility and blame stocks; silence operates as assent. The bad-apple scapegoat role and the first-rate chap defender role emerge as stable attractors. A Markov model demonstrates four regimes (runaway leader, runaway scapegoat, mixed stable, white-noise).", ,Yes,No,"Not applicable. Philosophical or cultural analysis, valuable for narrative and publication, but not patent-class."
TCPS,Temperament-Conditioned Policy Search,"Introduces a policy search method conditioned on temperament parameters. Shows how differential exploration pressures tied to temperament yield reproducible search behaviors across runs, and defines evaluators for matching temperament-coded exploration against benchmarks.", ,Yes,No,Not applicable
INV-GRD,Inversion Guardrail: Streaming Detection and Repair of Semantic Sign Flips in Dictation,"Presents a lightweight guardrail for real-time dictation. Detects semantic sign inversions (e.g., 'not'→'now') in streaming ASR output by embedding-level monitoring. A repair operator rewrites output with minimal latency cost.", ,No,Yes,"Independent method claim. A guardrail for detecting inversion events in streaming data pipelines. Elevator pitch: real-time inversion detector that prevents cascading errors in live systems. Framable as a safety mechanism, making it straightforward to claim."

Philosophical or cultural analysis, valuable for narrative and publication, but not patent-class."
MTFC,Measure Theoretic Flow Centrality,Defines a flow-centrality index over finite Markov flows using measure-theoretic weights. Shows ergodic averages converge to a centrality score reflecting action-betweenness under invariant transport., ,Yes,No,"Supporting role. Measure-Theoretic Flow Centrality defines a stable centrality index under aggregation. On its own, borderline patent-class, but should reinforce system claims about network monitoring, anomaly detection, or resilient planning."

Proves that parallel composition yields additive Murphy indices up to bounded slack, enabling distributed scheduling with probabilistic safety.", ,Yes,Yes,"Independent method/system claim. Defines hazard-per-time index allocation (Parallel Murphy Budgeting) to minimize time-to-rare-event. Elevator pitch: a new resource allocation engine that unifies rare-event search across offline, sequential, and online regimes. Useful for distributed compute, ML training, simulation, fuzzing, and reliability testing."
EMPH,Ecological Motion Perception Hypothesis,Posits that perception of motion is ecological: organisms detect affordances for movement by coupling to spectral invariants of flows. Formalizes a hypothesis that spectral tilt detection underwrites motion perception., ,Yes,No,"Not applicable. Philosophical or cultural analysis, valuable for narrative and publication, but not patent-class."

A 'path validity engine' for stochastic graph traversals using ergodic drift metrics. Elevator pitch: validates candidate trajectories cheaply and provably, applicable to robotics, compilers, ML rollouts, and simulations. Patentable as a system for verifying exploration paths."
IDM-PROJ,Idiom Projection,"Proposes idiom projection as a mechanism for translating between representational idioms (set-theoretic, categorical, stochastic). Defines functorial projections that preserve quotient-flow invariants.", ,Yes,No,"Supporting role. Idiom Projection is not standalone patent-class, but strengthens QFI-family claims by formalizing invariant-preserving model compression. Could be cited as part of a system for scaling and simplifying models without losing guarantees."
