## Abstract

We introduce measure-theoretic compile-time safety contracts for decision kernels. Defines σ-safety contracts, inversion guardrails, and Murphy clocks as hazard indices. Proves soundness and schedulability theorems, demonstrating compile-time enforceability of runtime safety properties.
