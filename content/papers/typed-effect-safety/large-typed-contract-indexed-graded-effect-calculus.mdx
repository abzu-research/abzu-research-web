## Abstract

An indexed, graded calculus that makes certain side‑effects untypable.

## Why it matters

We seek criteria and constructions that keep guarantees legible under drift, side‑effects, and limited perception.

## What’s new

A characterization that composes with the rest of the corpus and remains robust under perturbations.

## How it works

We sketch the construction, show worked examples, and discuss edge‑cases where assumptions fail.

## Connections
