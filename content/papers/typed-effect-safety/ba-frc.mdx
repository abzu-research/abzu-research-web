## Abstract

We formalize the public-state dynamics of groups under spectacle-mediated influence. Agents accrue visibility and blame stocks; silence operates as assent. The bad-apple scapegoat role and the first-rate chap defender role emerge as stable attractors. A Markov model demonstrates four regimes (runaway leader, runaway scapegoat, mixed stable, white-noise).
