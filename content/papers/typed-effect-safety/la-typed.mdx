  We present a typed, contract-indexed, graded effect calculus that makes safety a compile-time property and time-to-discovery a schedulable runtime guarantee. We give typing rules, grade algebra, and contract propagation; prove progress/preservation and effect soundness; and show a correctness theorem that well-typed programs compile to kernels satisfying indicated σ-contracts.

## Abstract

We present a typed, contract-indexed, graded effect calculus that makes safety a compile-time property and time-to-discovery a schedulable runtime guarantee. We give typing rules, grade algebra, and contract propagation; prove progress/preservation and effect soundness; and show a correctness theorem that well-typed programs compile to kernels satisfying indicated σ-contracts.
