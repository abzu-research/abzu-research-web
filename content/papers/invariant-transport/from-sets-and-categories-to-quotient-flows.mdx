## Abstract

A unifying perspective on flow under identification and collapse via quotient constructions.

## Why it matters

We seek criteria and constructions that keep guarantees legible under drift, side‑effects, and limited perception.

## What’s new

A characterization that composes with the rest of the corpus and remains robust under perturbations.

## How it works

We sketch the construction, show worked examples, and discuss edge‑cases where assumptions fail.

## Connections
