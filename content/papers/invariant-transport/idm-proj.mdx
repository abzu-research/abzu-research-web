## Abstract

Proposes idiom projection as a mechanism for translating between representational idioms (set-theoretic, categorical, stochastic). Defines functorial projections that preserve quotient-flow invariants.

## Technical Significance

Supporting role. Idiom Projection is not standalone patent-class, but strengthens QFI-family claims by formalizing invariant-preserving model compression. Could be cited as part of a system for scaling and simplifying models without losing guarantees.
