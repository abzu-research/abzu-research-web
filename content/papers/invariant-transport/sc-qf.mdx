## Abstract

We formulate a program that treats a broad class of discrete dynamical 'universes' as definable in multiple idioms—set–theoretic, category–theoretic, and quotient–flow. The spine is a modal shell with idiom-necessity operators, strengthened with idiom projections, Fisher–information transport, and ergodic–metric drift. Application: BA–FRC public-state model.
