## Abstract

Extends the QFI schema to drift and flow processes. Defines drift metrics, ergodic stability, and transport of invariants. Demonstrates applications to stochastic process translation.

## Technical Significance

Not independently patentable, but key supporting role in the QFI patent family. Provides invariant schema, spectral instrumentation, or drift/flow extensions. Should be referenced in broader system claims to strengthen enforceability.
