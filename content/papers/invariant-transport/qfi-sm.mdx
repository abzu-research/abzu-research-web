## Abstract

Builds the computable instrumentation layer atop the QFI program. Constructs a spectral–tilt calculus for path costs; defines the cumulant generating function Λ(t). Introduces Murphy horizons Lc and proves contraction lemmas. Justifies Action–Betweenness centrality as a QFI instance.

## Technical Significance

Not independently patentable, but key supporting role in the QFI patent family. Provides invariant schema, spectral instrumentation, or drift/flow extensions. Should be referenced in broader system claims to strengthen enforceability.
