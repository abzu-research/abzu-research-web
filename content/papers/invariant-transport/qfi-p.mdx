## Abstract

Defines the primitives of the QFI schema. Formalizes invariance conditions, monotonicity, and lumpability. Proves that QFI primitives form a universal backbone across idioms.

## Technical Significance

Not independently patentable, but key supporting role in the QFI patent family. Provides invariant schema, spectral instrumentation, or drift/flow extensions. Should be referenced in broader system claims to strengthen enforceability.
