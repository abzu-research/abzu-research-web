## Abstract

Defines a flow-centrality index over finite Markov flows using measure-theoretic weights. Shows ergodic averages converge to a centrality score reflecting action-betweenness under invariant transport.

## Technical Significance

Supporting role. Measure-Theoretic Flow Centrality defines a stable centrality index under aggregation. On its own, borderline patent-class, but should reinforce system claims about network monitoring, anomaly detection, or resilient planning.
