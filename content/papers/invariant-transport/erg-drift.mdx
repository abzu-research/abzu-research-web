## Abstract

Introduces an ergodic drift metric to evaluate path validity in finite-state graphs. Shows that ergodic averages provide stability indices for long-run validity, enabling drift-based pruning of infeasible paths.

## Technical Significance

Independent method claim. A 'path validity engine' for stochastic graph traversals using ergodic drift metrics. Elevator pitch: validates candidate trajectories cheaply and provably, applicable to robotics, compilers, ML rollouts, and simulations. Patentable as a system for verifying exploration paths.
