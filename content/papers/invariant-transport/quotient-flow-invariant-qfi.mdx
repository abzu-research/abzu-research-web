## Abstract

A dual to Fisher information capturing invariants under observation limitations.

## Why it matters

We seek criteria and constructions that keep guarantees legible under drift, side‑effects, and limited perception.

## What’s new

A characterization that composes with the rest of the corpus and remains robust under perturbations.

## How it works

We sketch the construction, show worked examples, and discuss edge‑cases where assumptions fail.

## Connections

See related papers in this program and the Elliott Framework overview.
