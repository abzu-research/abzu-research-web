\section{Introduction}
Modern information geometry equips statistical models with a Riemannian structure via the Fisher information metric. 
Natural--gradient updates are geodesic flows on this geometry, endowing inference dynamics with coordinate--free meaning.
We ask a stronger question: can a single, reparameterization--invariant action on probability densities and velocity potentials reproduce the equations of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics?
If so, we would obtain a falsifiable bridge between inference and physics, separating metaphor from mechanism.

We answer in the affirmative for scalar, spinless systems: a Fisher--curvature term combined with a continuity constraint yields quantum hydrodynamics (Madelung) and hence the Schr\"odinger equation after a single scale identification.
We position this as a testable \emph{quotient--flow} principle: physics and learning share the same information--geometric skeleton once we identify equivalence classes of parametrizations.

\paragraph{Contributions.}
(i) An invariant Fisher--action on equivalence classes $\Theta/\mathcal{G}$ yields continuity $+$ quantum Hamilton--Jacobi (QHJ). 
(ii) A concise, reproducible extremization algorithm that predicts discrete spectra without postulating a wavefunction.
(iii) Error--scaling predictions with grid spacing and a single global scale $\lambda$.
(iv) Limits: classical ($\lambda\to 0$) and diffusive ($\lambda<0$).
(v) A roadmap to spin/gauge via bundle--valued Fisher terms.

\section{Quotient Flows and Fisher Geometry}
Let $\mathcal{P}=\{p(x;\theta): x \in \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d,\ \theta\in\Theta\}$ denote a family of densities.
The Fisher metric is
\begin{equation}
g_{ij}(\theta)=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim p(\cdot;\theta)}\big[\partial_i \log p\, \partial_j \log p\big]\,.
\end{equation}
Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a group of reparametrizations $\theta\mapsto \phi(\theta)$ preserving the predictive content of $p$ (e.g., smooth bijections or gauge symmetries in a graphical model).

\begin{definition}[Quotient Flow]
A \emph{quotient flow} is a trajectory on equivalence classes $[\theta] \in \Theta/\mathcal{G}$ induced by a functional that is invariant under $\mathcal{G}$. 
In the density representation, this means dynamics depend only on $p$ and geometrical quantities derived from $p$, not on coordinates of $\theta$.
\end{definition}

Natural--gradient descent $\dot{\theta}=-\eta\, F(\theta)^{-1}\nabla_\theta L$ produces coordinate--free dynamics.
Here we take an action on $(p,\phi)$ that is explicitly invariant and derive equations of motion by variational calculus.

\section{Fisher--Action Principle}
Let $p(x,t)\ge 0$ integrate to $1$ for each $t$, and let $\phi(x,t)$ be a velocity potential.
Define Fisher information
\begin{equation}
I_F[p]=\int_\Omega \frac{|\nabla p|^2}{4p}\, dx = \int_\Omega |\nabla \sqrt{p}|^2\,dx\,.
\end{equation}
Consider the action
\begin{equation}
S[p,\phi]=\int_{t_0}^{t_1}\!\!\int_\Omega \Big(\lambda\, |\nabla \sqrt{p}|^2 + p\big(\partial_t \phi + \tfrac{1}{2}|\nabla \phi|^2 + V(x)\big)\Big)\, dx\, dt\,,
\label{eq:action}
\end{equation}
with $\lambda$ a global constant and $V$ a potential.

\begin{theorem}[Stationarity yields continuity + QHJ]
Subject to variations $\delta p,\delta \phi$ vanishing on the boundary, stationarity of $S$ implies
\begin{align}
\partial_t p + \nabla \cdot \big(p \nabla \phi\big) &= 0 \quad \text{(continuity)} \label{eq:continuity}\\
\partial_t \phi + \tfrac{1}{2}|\nabla \phi|^2 + V + Q &= 0 \quad \text{(QHJ)} \label{eq:QHJ}
\end{align}
with quantum potential $Q = \lambda\, \frac{\Delta \sqrt{p}}{\sqrt{p}}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Vary $\phi$: $\delta S = \int p\, \delta(\partial_t\phi + \tfrac12 |\nabla\phi|^2)\,dx\,dt = \int \big(-\partial_t p - \nabla\cdot(p\nabla\phi)\big)\delta\phi\,dx\,dt$, giving \eqref{eq:continuity}.
Vary $p$: the Fisher term yields $\delta \int \lambda |\nabla\sqrt{p}|^2 = \int \lambda\, \frac{\Delta \sqrt{p}}{\sqrt{p}}\, \delta p \, dx$ by standard calculus of variations; the rest contributes $\delta \int p(\partial_t\phi + \tfrac12 |\nabla\phi|^2+V) = \int (\partial_t\phi + \tfrac12 |\nabla\phi|^2+V)\, \delta p\, dx$. 
Setting the integrand to zero gives \eqref{eq:QHJ}.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Equivalence to Schr\"odinger.}
Let $\psi=\sqrt{p}\, e^{i \phi/\hbar}$. Identify $\lambda=\hbar^2/m$ and define velocity $\bm v=\nabla \phi$.
Then \eqref{eq:continuity} and \eqref{eq:QHJ} are equivalent to the real and imaginary parts of the Schr\"odinger equation $i\hbar\, \partial_t \psi = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\Delta \psi + V\psi$.
Thus the wavefunction arises as a bundle--valued section over the quotient space; it is not postulated but reconstructed from $(p,\phi)$.

\section{Limits and Interpretation}
\paragraph{Classical limit.}
As $\lambda\to 0$, $Q\to 0$ and \eqref{eq:QHJ} reduces to the classical Hamilton--Jacobi equation with velocity field $\nabla \phi$.

\paragraph{Diffusive/Stochastic limit.}
For $\lambda<0$ (interpretable as an entropic penalty), one obtains a sign--flipped quantum potential consistent with diffusive dynamics; in discrete form this approaches Fokker--Planck evolution. We do not claim physicality for $\lambda<0$â€”it is a modeling dial highlighting the role of curvature.

\paragraph{Quotient invariance.}
Any reparametrization $\theta\mapsto \phi(\theta)$ inducing the same density $p$ leaves $S$ invariant, so trajectories are properties of the equivalence class $[p]$ rather than coordinates. This is the sense in which physics and learning share a quotient--flow backbone.

\section{Discrete Extremization: A Decisive Test}
We give a reproducible scheme that, if it fails under the stated tolerance, falsifies the proposal.

\subsection{Stationary states as constrained minimizers}
For time--independent $V$, seek stationary $p(x),\phi(x)$ with $\partial_t p = 0$ and $\partial_t \phi = -E$ (constant). Then \eqref{eq:continuity} gives $\nabla\cdot(p\nabla \phi)=0$; for bound states in 1D we may take $\nabla \phi = 0$ (no net flow). Equation \eqref{eq:QHJ} becomes
\begin{equation}
E = V(x) + \lambda \frac{\Delta \sqrt{p}}{\sqrt{p}}\,.
\end{equation}
Let $u=\sqrt{p}$, enforce $\int u^2=1$, and minimize the functional
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}[u] = \int \Big(\lambda |\nabla u|^2 + V u^2 \Big)\,dx \quad \text{subject to } \int u^2\,dx=1\,.
\label{eq:energy}
\end{equation}
The Euler--Lagrange equation yields $-2\lambda \Delta u + 2 V u = 2 E u$, i.e., the time--independent Schr\"odinger equation with the identification $\lambda=\hbar^2/(2m)$. Our calibration uses $\lambda=\hbar^2/m$ in \eqref{eq:action}, consistent up to conventional factors.

\subsection{Finite--difference scheme}
Discretize $\Omega=[0,L]$ into $N$ points with spacing $\Delta x$, with Dirichlet boundary conditions for the infinite well and natural decays for harmonic wells on a sufficiently large interval.
Approximate $\int |\nabla u|^2 \approx \sum (u_{i+1}-u_i)^2 / \Delta x$ and $\int V u^2 \approx \sum V_i u_i^2\, \Delta x$.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Fisher--Action Ground State (1D)}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State \textbf{Input:} grid $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$, potential $V_i$, step sizes $\eta_u,\eta_\mu$, target tolerance $\epsilon$, calibration level index $k^\star$
\State Initialize $u \leftarrow$ positive random, then normalize $u \leftarrow u/\|u\|_2$
\State Initialize Lagrange multiplier $\mu\leftarrow 0$
\Repeat
  \State Compute gradient $g \leftarrow -2\lambda \Delta_d u + 2 V \odot u - 2 \mu u$
  \State $u \leftarrow u - \eta_u\, g$ \Comment{natural--gradient preconditioning optional}
  \State $u \leftarrow \max(u, 0)$; \quad $u \leftarrow u / \|u\|_2$
  \State Update $\mu \leftarrow \mu + \eta_\mu\, (\|u\|_2^2 - 1)$
\Until{relative change in $\mathcal{E}[u]$ below $\epsilon$}
\State \textbf{Output:} $E_0=\mathcal{E}[u]$, $u$ as ground state; calibrate $\lambda$ so $E_{k^\star}$ matches analytic value
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\paragraph{Calibration and prediction.} Choose a single known eigenvalue to fix $\lambda$ (e.g., $E_0$ in a harmonic well). Without further tuning, predict $E_1,E_2,\ldots$ and compare with analytical spectra. 

\subsection{Error scaling prediction}
Let $\Delta x$ be the grid spacing. For the centered finite--difference Laplacian, the discretization error in energies scales as $O(\Delta x^2)$ assuming sufficient regularity of $u$ and $V$. Thus, after fixing $\lambda$ once, the relative error $\delta E/E$ for higher levels should decay $\propto \Delta x^2$ as the grid is refined, up to conditioning effects for high $n$.

\section{Results to Expect (Before You Run Them)}
\paragraph{Infinite well $[0,L]$.}
Analytical energies $E_n = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2m L^2} n^2$. After setting $\lambda$ from $E_1$, predicted $E_2/E_1\approx 4$, $E_3/E_1\approx 9$ should hold within $<1\%$ for $N\gtrsim 500$ with our discretization. Deviations follow the $O(\Delta x^2)$ law.

\paragraph{Harmonic well.}
With $V(x)=\tfrac12 m\omega^2 x^2$, energies $E_n = \hbar \omega (n+\tfrac12)$. After fixing $\lambda$ on $E_0$, all $E_n$ fall into line; the shape $u_n(x)$ aligns with Hermite--Gauss modes under standard inner products.

\section{Relation to Learning Dynamics}
The functional $\mathcal{E}[u]$ is a Rayleigh quotient; its gradient descent is equivalent to power iteration on a discretized self--adjoint operator. In learning terms, the Fisher term penalizes curvature in $\sqrt{p}$, acting as a data--dependent smoothness prior.
Natural gradient interprets as preconditioning by the Fisher metric, which here is built into the action itself.

\section{Related Work (Contextual, Non-Exhaustive)}
Information geometry (Amari), entropic and entropic--dynamics derivations of quantum mechanics (Jaynes; Caticha), Fisher--information physics (Frieden), stochastic mechanics (Nelson), and hydrodynamic quantum formulations (Madelung) all touch adjacent ideas.
Our novelty is the quotient--flow framing with a single, crisp empirical protocol and falsification criteria, plus the explicit bridge to learning dynamics.

\section{Limitations and Extensions}
\paragraph{Spin and gauge.}
Spin requires extending $u$ to a section of a spinor bundle and adding gauge--equivariant Fisher terms. Gauge fields suggest replacing gradients by covariant derivatives in the action. These are nontrivial but straightforward directions.

\paragraph{Open systems.}
Dissipation and decoherence can be modeled by adding Kullback--Leibler or cross--entropy terms to the action, breaking unitarity in controlled ways.

\paragraph{Relativistic generalization.}
A Lorentz--covariant Fisher action would require careful treatment of probability densities on spacelike hypersurfaces; beyond scope here.

\section{Predictions and Falsification Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{P1 (Spectral match).} After calibrating $\lambda$ with one level, predicted eigenvalues for the infinite and harmonic wells match analytical values within $<1\%$ for sufficiently fine grids. Failure falsifies the claim.
\item \textbf{P2 (Error law).} Relative error scales as $O(\Delta x^2)$ under grid refinement. Different discretizers change the slope but preserve polynomial order.
\item \textbf{P3 (Classical limit).} As $\lambda\to 0$, the method reduces to classical Hamilton--Jacobi; numerical trajectories converge to classical characteristics.
\item \textbf{P4 (Diffusive dial).} For $\lambda<0$, evolution mimics diffusive spread consistent with Fokker--Planck; we do not claim physicality, but the sign flip must behave predictably.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
A single reparameterization--invariant Fisher action on quotient flows suffices to recover the scalar Schr\"odinger equation and gives a compact recipe for decisive tests.
Whether nature ``uses'' this action is not settled by elegance but by spectra: calibrate once, predict many, check the errors.
Either the numbers line up under the stated conditions or they do not.
That is the right kind of unification: one that risks being wrong in public.

\appendix
\section{Detailed Variations}
We sketch the calculus of variations for the Fisher term. Let $u=\sqrt{p}$. Then
\begin{equation}
\delta \int \lambda |\nabla u|^2 dx = 2\lambda \int \nabla u \cdot \nabla (\delta u)\, dx = -2\lambda \int \Delta u\, \delta u\, dx + \text{boundary}\,.
\end{equation}
With $p=u^2$, $\delta p = 2 u\, \delta u$ gives the form in the main text.

\section{Discrete Operator Form}
On a uniform grid, define the symmetric tridiagonal Laplacian $L$ with $(Lu)_i = (u_{i+1}-2u_i+u_{i-1})/\Delta x^2$ and diagonal potential matrix $V$. Then minimizing \eqref{eq:energy} under $\|u\|_2=1$ is equivalent to the eigenproblem
\begin{equation}
( -\lambda L + V ) u = E u\,.
\end{equation}
Our gradient scheme is equivalent to power iteration with normalization and optional shift--invert acceleration.

\section{Algorithmic Details and Practical Notes}
Use reflective boundary conditions for harmonic wells on a large domain to reduce boundary artifacts.
Normalize frequently to avoid drift in $\|u\|_2$.
For excited states, orthogonalize $u$ against previously found modes at each step (Gram--Schmidt). 
Natural--gradient preconditioning corresponds to solving $(G+\epsilon I)\Delta u = -g$ where $G$ approximates the Fisher metric in discretized coordinates.
