## Abstract

Presents a lightweight guardrail for real-time dictation. Detects semantic sign inversions (e.g., 'not'→'now') in streaming ASR output by embedding-level monitoring. A repair operator rewrites output with minimal latency cost.

## Technical Significance

Independent method claim. A guardrail for detecting inversion events in streaming data pipelines. Elevator pitch: real-time inversion detector that prevents cascading errors in live systems. Framable as a safety mechanism, making it straightforward to claim.
