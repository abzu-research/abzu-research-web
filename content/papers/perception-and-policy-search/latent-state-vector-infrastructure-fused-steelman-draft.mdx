\begin{abstract}
Latent State Vectors (LSVs) are introduced as first-class
computational primitives for reasoning systems. Unlike conventional
hidden activations treated as ephemeral intermediates, LSVs are
persistent objects that can be rehydrated, indexed, and constrained.
This paper presents the fused, steelmanned consolidation of prior
branches (lsvi.tex, ghi.tex, jsksi.tex, bzjd.tex, and ancillary notes).
The resulting monolith establishes a coherent framework for:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Worldline rehydration and path fidelity,
  \item Batch analytics and Cassandra-class pre-indexing,
  \item Phylogenetic workflows for lineage and influence mapping,
  \item Compile-time safety and non-reversibility contracts,
  \item Privacy-constrained governance for secure deployment.
\end{itemize}

Together these define Latent State Vector Infrastructure as both a
theoretical construct and a practical system. The program connects
measure-theoretic, category-theoretic, and information-geometric
formalisms into a single infrastructure for scalable reasoning.

\section{Introduction}

The Latent State Vector Infrastructure (LSVI) project establishes a
foundational infrastructure for storing, rehydrating, and governing the
latent states of learning systems. Where traditional machine learning
pipelines discard activations once downstream computation is complete,
LSVI treats them as durable entities. This enables re-entry into prior
worldlines of reasoning, systematic batch analytics, and novel forms of
phylogenetic tracking across generations of models.

Earlier development branches each advanced complementary perspectives:
\texttt{lsvi.tex} developed the worldline rehydration thesis; 
\texttt{ghi.tex} emphasized compile-time guarantees; 
\texttt{jsksi.tex} elaborated the batch analytics layer; 
\texttt{bzjd.tex} explored governance and privacy. 
The present fused draft integrates these into a coherent, steelmanned
account, extending their results and formalizing common principles.

This infrastructure is framed at the intersection of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Measure theory}, for quantifying rehydration fidelity and
        bounding information drift;
  \item \textbf{Category theory}, for idiom transport, functoriality, and
        compositional guarantees;
  \item \textbf{Information geometry}, for drift measures and canonical
        attractors;
  \item \textbf{Systems engineering}, for practical guarantees of
        availability, integrity, and privacy.
\end{itemize}

\section{Core Formalism}

\subsection{Latent States and Worldlines}

\begin{definition}[Latent State Vector]
A \emph{Latent State Vector (LSV)} is a tuple
\[
  v = (\mathbf{h}, \Sigma, \tau)
\]
where $\mathbf{h}$ is an activation vector in $\mathbb{R}^d$,
$\Sigma$ is a covariance structure representing uncertainty,
and $\tau$ is a temporal or generational index.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Worldline]
A \emph{worldline} $W$ is a finite or infinite sequence of LSVs
\[
  W = (v_0, v_1, v_2, \ldots)
\]
such that each $v_{i+1}$ is generated by a deterministic or stochastic
transition kernel $K(v_i)$. Worldlines are the rehydration targets of
LSVI: they are the structured reasoning trajectories that can be
interrupted, stored, and resumed.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Rehydration and Fidelity}

\begin{definition}[Rehydration]
Given a compressed or stored representation $c$ of an LSV $v$, a
\emph{rehydration operator} $R$ reconstructs an approximation
$\hat{v} = R(c)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Fidelity]
The \emph{rehydration fidelity} of $\hat{v}$ relative to $v$ is
\[
  F(v, \hat{v}) = \exp\big( - D_{\mathrm{KL}}(p_v \,\|\, p_{\hat{v}}) \big),
\]
where $p_v$ and $p_{\hat{v}}$ are probability measures induced by
$v$ and $\hat{v}$ respectively, and $D_{\mathrm{KL}}$ is
Kullback–Leibler divergence.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Bounded Drift]
If rehydration fidelity satisfies $F(v, \hat{v}) > 1-\epsilon$, then
expected drift along the rehydrated worldline is bounded:
\[
  \mathbb{E}\big[ d(W, \hat{W}) \big] < C\epsilon
\]
for constant $C$ depending only on the transition kernel $K$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[Sketch]
The argument follows from coupling of $K$-driven Markov chains with
small initial divergence, combined with Pinsker’s inequality.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Indexing and Cassandra-Class Guarantees}

LSVI posits that stored LSVs can be organized into corpora supporting
high-throughput retrieval. This requires distributed indexing guarantees
comparable to Cassandra-class databases.

\begin{theorem}[Availability]
For an $n$-replicated LSV corpus under quorum read/write policy $(R,W)$,
availability satisfies
\[
  P_{\text{avail}} = 1 - (1-p)^{n}
\]
where $p$ is the per-node availability probability.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Consistency Bound]
If $R+W > n$, then every read observes the latest write. This is the
standard Cassandra guarantee, transposed to the LSV corpus layer.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Contracts and Safety}

\begin{definition}[Non-Reversibility Contract]
An LSV corpus satisfies a \emph{non-reversibility contract} if no
efficient adversary can reconstruct raw input tokens from stored LSVs
with probability greater than negligible in the security parameter.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Hash-Salted Projection]
Let stored LSVs be projected through a salted locality-sensitive hash.
Then the non-reversibility contract holds under standard assumptions
about preimage resistance.
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}[Compile-Time Flow Centrality]
A computation graph $G$ over LSVs satisfies \emph{flow centrality} if
for every path $\pi$, Fisher-information drift is bounded by a constant
$\kappa$ depending only on $\pi$’s length:
\[
  I(\pi) \leq \kappa \cdot \lvert \pi \rvert .
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Compile-Time Verifiability]
Flow centrality is statically checkable at compile time by induction on
graph composition rules.
\end{theorem}

\newpage

\section{Batch Analytics}

\subsection{Corpus Formation}

An \emph{LSV corpus} is a collection of latent states sampled across
worldlines, stored in a distributed structure supporting indexing,
retrieval, and transformation. Corpora are the raw material for
analytics: they enable both local anomaly detection and global
structural inference.

\begin{definition}[Corpus]
A corpus $\mathcal{C}$ is a set of LSVs together with an indexing map
\[
  \iota : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{I}
\]
into an index space $\mathcal{I}$ supporting nearest-neighbor queries
under Fisher information distance.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Anomaly Detection}

Anomaly detection is formalized as deviation from canonical clusters in
$\mathcal{I}$.

\begin{proposition}[Fisher Outlier Score]
For LSV $v \in \mathcal{C}$, the outlier score is
\[
  O(v) = \min_{u \in \mathcal{C} \setminus \{v\}} d_F(v,u),
\]
where $d_F$ is Fisher-information distance. If $O(v)$ exceeds threshold
$\theta$, $v$ is an anomaly.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Influence Mapping}

By tracking transitions and measuring Fisher-distance contributions,
LSVI supports causal attribution across a corpus.

\begin{definition}[Influence Weight]
Given $u,v \in \mathcal{C}$, the influence weight $w(u,v)$ is the
expected marginal change in $v$’s distribution attributable to $u$,
normalized by corpus size.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Influence Network]
The directed graph $G$ with vertices $\mathcal{C}$ and edges weighted by
$w(u,v)$ forms an influence network whose Laplacian spectrum encodes
causal pathways through latent space.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Pre-Indexing Strategies}

Efficient analytics requires pre-indexing under compressed structures.

\begin{proposition}[Bloom Projection]
Mapping $\mathcal{C}$ into a Bloom filter of size $m$ yields false
positive rate $(1-e^{-kn/m})^k$, standard from probabilistic data
structures.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}[Hashed Identifier Integrity]
If LSVs are stored under salted cryptographic hashes, identifier
collisions are negligible in the security parameter.
\end{proposition}

\newpage

\section{Phylogenetic Workflows}

\subsection{Lineage Construction}

LSVI enables the construction of \emph{lineages} of worldlines,
capturing descent and divergence across generations.

\begin{definition}[Lineage]
A lineage is a rooted tree $T$ whose nodes are LSVs and whose edges are
transitions with rehydration fidelity above threshold $\phi$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Borel–Cantelli Convergence]
Given infinite sampling of descendant worldlines, improbable but
non-zero divergence events are almost surely realized, guaranteeing that
lineage trees reflect the full ergodic support of the transition kernel.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Alignment Operators}

Alignment is achieved via functorial operators across categories of
worldlines.

\begin{definition}[Alignment Functor]
Let $\mathcal{W}_1, \mathcal{W}_2$ be categories of worldlines. An
alignment functor $F : \mathcal{W}_1 \to \mathcal{W}_2$ preserves
rehydration fidelity up to $\epsilon$ and respects canonical attractors.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Functorial Stability]
Composition of alignment functors preserves bounded drift and
non-reversibility contracts.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Influence Phylogenies}

Influence networks over corpora admit phylogenetic decomposition.

\begin{theorem}[Spectral Decomposition]
The Laplacian spectrum of the influence graph admits decomposition into
clades of mutually reinforcing influence, defining phylogenetic modules.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}[Causal Phylogenies]
Phylogenetic modules correspond to causal attractors in latent state
space, enabling detection of emergent dynamics not visible at the token
level.
\end{corollary}

\newpage

\section{Contracts and Governance}

\subsection{Non-Reversibility Selector}

\begin{definition}[Non-Reversibility Selector]
A \emph{non-reversibility selector} is an operator $S$ on stored LSVs
that guarantees no efficient adversary can invert $S(v)$ to recover
tokens with probability better than negligible in the security parameter.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Thermodynamic Consistency]
If $S$ enforces Gibbs free energy monotonicity in representation space,
then non-reversibility is equivalent to the second law of
thermodynamics. Thus information-theoretic contracts align with
thermodynamic irreversibility.
\end{proposition}

\begin{corollary}[Security–Physics Duality]
Non-reversibility selectors prove that security guarantees and physical
irreversibility are formally dual, both governed by Fisher-information
geometry.
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Compile-Time Guarantees}

\begin{theorem}[Static Flow Centrality]
Any computation graph validated under compile-time flow centrality is
guaranteed to bound Fisher-information drift per path, preventing
unbounded error amplification.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proposition}[Modal Drift Handling]
If modal idioms are introduced as functorial decorations on worldlines,
then compile-time type checking ensures drift corrections are sound and
terminating.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Murphy Budgeting}

Rare-event inevitabilities require resource budgeting.

\begin{definition}[Murphy Budget]
A Murphy budget $B(\epsilon, T)$ allocates resources sufficient to
ensure that, within horizon $T$, all events of probability at least
$\epsilon$ will be encountered with high probability.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Budget Sufficiency]
If $B(\epsilon, T)$ satisfies
\[
  B(\epsilon, T) \geq \frac{\log(1/\delta)}{\epsilon}
\]
then with probability $1-\delta$ all $\epsilon$-probability events are
encountered within horizon $T$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}[KI–Murphy Correspondence]
Kantian Inevitability implies that canonical forms under shared
constraints emerge inevitably. Murphy budgeting provides the resource
bounds under which such emergence is practically guaranteed.
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Privacy-Constrained Governance}

LSVI deployment requires governance mechanisms that preserve privacy
under analytics.

\begin{proposition}[Homomorphic Storage]
If LSV corpora are stored under fully homomorphic encryption, then
rehydration and analytics can be performed without exposing raw latent
states.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}[Differential Privacy]
If corpus queries satisfy $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy, then
no adversary can distinguish participation of individual LSVs beyond
the specified bounds.
\end{proposition}

\begin{theorem}[Governance Envelope]
A governance envelope $\mathcal{G}$ is a set of constraints on storage,
query, and analytics operations. If all operations respect
$\mathcal{G}$, then non-reversibility, compile-time, and privacy
contracts jointly hold.
\end{theorem}

\newpage

\section{Extended Formalism and Open Questions}

\subsection{Idiomatic Transport and Quotient Flows}

The LSVI formalism is compatible with idiom-translation programs.
Multiple mathematical languages—measure theory, category theory,
information geometry—yield equivalent descriptions of the same
structures.

\begin{definition}[Idiom Equivalence]
Two idioms $\mathcal{I}_1$ and $\mathcal{I}_2$ are equivalent with
respect to an LSV corpus $\mathcal{C}$ if there exists a functor
$F : \mathcal{I}_1 \to \mathcal{I}_2$ such that for all
$v \in \mathcal{C}$, rehydration fidelity and flow centrality are
preserved up to $\epsilon$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Quotient Flow Preservation]
Quotient structures of $\mathcal{C}$ under observational equivalence
preserve Fisher-information invariants. Thus reduced forms are valid for
analytics without information loss.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Kantian Inevitability in LSVI}

Kantian Inevitability (KI) states that under constraints, canonical
forms emerge inevitably, regardless of initial conditions.

\begin{theorem}[Inevitability of Canonical Forms]
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an LSV corpus constrained by $\Gamma$. Then for
any initialization, there exists $T$ such that for all $t > T$,
rehydrated worldlines converge to the same canonical attractor $c$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}[LSVI–KI Duality]
Within QFI, KI is expressed as convergence in Fisher space. Within LSVI,
KI is expressed as inevitable convergence of rehydrated worldlines under
shared constraints. The duality establishes equivalence of metaphysical
and infrastructural inevitability.
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Ergodic Drift and Path Validity}

\begin{definition}[Ergodic Drift]
An ergodic drift operator $D$ ensures that improbable but nonzero events
are realized almost surely under infinite sampling.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Path Validity Engine]
If LSV corpora are extended under ergodic drift, then all valid paths in
latent space are eventually realized, yielding completeness of the
phylogenetic tree.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Unmodal Drift and Shelfer Operators}

Unmodal drift addresses failure modes in inference where rehydration
transitions leave established idioms.

\begin{definition}[Unmodal Drift]
A drift event is unmodal if it exits the support of canonical idioms
without guarantee of return.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Shelfer Repair]
If an LSV undergoes unmodal drift, a Shelfer operator $S$ may map it
back into canonical support, preserving compile-time guarantees.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Effect Calculi and Architectural Scaling}

Large-scale architectures require graded effect calculi to track drift,
fidelity, and contract satisfaction compositionally.

\begin{definition}[Effect Calculus for LSVI]
An effect calculus $\mathcal{E}$ assigns to each morphism of worldlines
a graded annotation $(\phi, \delta, \rho)$ representing fidelity,
drift, and resource usage. Composition laws enforce additive bounds.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Soundness of Graded Effects]
If $\mathcal{E}$ is respected under composition, then all end-to-end
worldline computations satisfy fidelity and non-reversibility contracts
by construction.
\end{theorem}

\newpage

preserved up to $\epsilon$.
\end{definition}

Quotient structures of $\mathcal{C}$ under observational equivalence
preserve Fisher-information invariants. Thus reduced forms are valid for
analytics without information loss.

and infrastructural inevitability.

\section{Conclusion}

The Latent State Vector Infrastructure (LSVI) provides a coherent
infrastructure for treating latent states as first-class computational
primitives. By fusing worldline rehydration, batch analytics,
phylogenetic workflows, compile-time safety, and privacy-constrained
governance, LSVI establishes the scaffolding for both theoretical
unification and practical deployment.

The contributions of this fused, steelmanned draft are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A formal definition of LSVs and worldlines, with fidelity bounds
        under rehydration.
  \item Corpus-level analytics for anomaly detection, influence mapping,
        and phylogenetic decomposition.
  \item Compile-time contracts guaranteeing non-reversibility and bounded
        Fisher-information drift.
  \item A synthesis of Kantian Inevitability with infrastructural
        convergence, showing inevitability of canonical forms.
  \item Extensions to ergodic drift, unmodal drift, Shelfer operators,
        and graded effect calculi.
\end{itemize}

LSVI is not merely a theoretical exercise. It is a practical system:
distributed, indexable, and governable like a Cassandra-class database,
but applied to the latent states of reasoning systems. The result is a
platform that enables rehydration of worldlines, analytics of latent
flows, and secure, privacy-preserving governance of stored states.

This draft integrates multiple development branches into a single,
coherent artifact. It stands as a blueprint for further work in latent
state infrastructures, where metaphysical principles (inevitability,
ergodicity, information geometry) are expressed directly as
compile-time, runtime, and governance contracts. As such, it represents
a decisive step toward the infrastructural layer of the future of
reasoning systems.
