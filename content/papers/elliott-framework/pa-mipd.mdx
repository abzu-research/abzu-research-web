## Abstract

Theorem 1 (Predictable Atavism Law). Suppose m is shallow and the substrate trajectory intersects V(m)… with probability one there exists t⋆ such that a realized shell St⋆ implements m up to bounded morphological distance and persists. The contingency of first identity follows from comparing crossing times and frictions. The recurrence of shallow morphs is law-like.
