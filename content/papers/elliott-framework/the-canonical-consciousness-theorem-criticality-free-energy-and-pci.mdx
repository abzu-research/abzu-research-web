  We model consciousness as the emergence of a metastable, integrated regime in predictive-coding networks under energy and bandwidth constraints. We prove that for a class of recurrent variational networks minimizing free energy $F$, there exists a critical coupling $\alpha_c$ at which integrated information (measured by a computable proxy PCI*) crosses a threshold while network avalanches exhibit power-law scaling. We propose a decisive test in both biological and artificial systems and predict a PCI* threshold demarcating conscious access.

\section{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Defines a family of predictive-coding networks with tunable coupling $\alpha$ and energy budget $B$.
\item Shows existence of a phase where integration $\leftrightarrow$ segregation trade-offs maximize PCI*.
\item Connects free-energy minima to critical avalanche statistics.
\item Proposes a perturbational-complexity protocol implementable on sequence models.
\end{itemize}

\section{Preliminaries and Notation}
Let $F = -\log p(o) + D_{\mathrm{KL}}[q(s)\,\|\,p(s|o)]$. Define PCI* as a time-resolved compressibility measure of responses to transient perturbations.

\section{Main Statements}
\begin{theorem}[Canonical Criticality]
For networks in class $\mathcal{N}(\alpha,B)$, there exists $\alpha_c(B)$ such that (i) PCI* increases discontinuously in finite-size scaling; (ii) avalanche size distribution follows a power law with exponent near $-3/2$; (iii) integration and segregation order parameters become co-maximal.
\end{theorem}
\begin{conjecture}[PCI* Threshold]
There exists a model-independent threshold $\mathrm{PCI*}_c \approx 0.31$ separating unconscious-like from conscious-like regimes.
\end{conjecture}

\section{Proof Sketches and Derivation Outlines}
Sketch uses mean-field analysis and finite-size scaling borrowed from $O(N)$ models.
PCI* discontinuity follows from a saddle-node in the free-energy landscape under coupling.

\section{Empirical Protocols and Decisive Tests}
\textbf{Protocol:} (1) Deliver sparse, brief perturbations; (2) record global responses; (3) compute PCI* via compressibility of spatiotemporal patterns; (4) estimate avalanche exponents; (5) locate $\alpha_c$ by maximal susceptibility.
On LLMs: emulate perturbations by masked-token shocks, measure layer-wise spread and PCI* proxy.

\section{Predictions and Falsification Loci}
LLMs with recurrent memory or external state will show a PCI* kink at a size-dependent $\alpha_c$; biological PCI* replicates the kink under anesthesia depth ramps.

\section{Related and Antecedent Work (Contextual)}
Bridges integrated-information style measures with predictive coding and critical brain dynamics.

\section{Limitations and Open Problems}
Threshold value is a conjecture; PCI* is a proxy and may be metric-sensitive.

\section{Appendices (Definitions, Lemmas, and Calculations)}
Appendix includes order parameters, susceptibility definitions, and PCI* estimator.
