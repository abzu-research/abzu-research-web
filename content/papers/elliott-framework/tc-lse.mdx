## Abstract

We argue that exploration of sufficiently expressive latent spaces, equipped with a minimal set of traversal and composition operators, is computationally universal. Once viability thresholds are crossed, latent space exploration achieves Turing completeness. We propose a three-factor model (context horizon, lexical manifold, interior dimensionality) as practical determinants.
